During the ram shortage, with ram going up to 3x or more of what it used to be, its best not to buy more ram than needed.

With this NAS Ram Planner, you can either input all the specifics of the NAS yourself, or use the presets for the most common NAS models and confugurations, and it will tell you how muhc ram is needed minimum, how much storage is available with your RAID setup and how much the ram is likely to cost.
